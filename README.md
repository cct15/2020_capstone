## Project Introduction
Betta fish is considered as a great candidate species for the domestic animal model to figure out how evolution can affect the traits of the domestic animals for the sake of its relatively short generation time and absence of ethical concern. In this project, we present a complete set of methods to automatically process Betta fish pictures in large quantities by using self-designed algorithms to calibrate and crop Betta fish images and transfer learning to segment fish bodies. Then we run the genetic mapping between genotypes and phenotypes to link genetic loci to individual traits which enable us to obtain convincing results to figure out which marker the features depend on and what type a gene is.
